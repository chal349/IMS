Inventory Management System 1.0 

---------------------

Created to demonstrate MVC practices and object-oriented programming.

This project is a multiple-screen, JavaFX application to manage an inventory system for parts and products.
The application allows users to enter, edit, and delete parts (In-House or Out-Sourced), and products. 
It features validation for data entered by the user, and prevents products from being deleted if they contain parts.
This application will NOT persist data into a database.
